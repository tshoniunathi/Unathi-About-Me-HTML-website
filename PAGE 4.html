            <h2>Big data</h2>
            <p>My goal is to be a data scientist or analyst. The idea that the management and manipulation of raw data can in turn be tangible and be used to make practical real-world decisions is fascinating. <br> Beyond the physical products we produce, coding fosters a special kind of problem-solving, and I like problems. <br> It is a practice in dividing up difficult problems into more manageable parts. <br> Developing critical thinking skills through coding encourages us to tackle problems methodically and persistently until we find solutions.<br> I also have a new found interest in front end development.</p>
