            <h2>Why coding?</h2>
            <p>We live in a world that is driven by technology, the art of coding has evolved from being basic text lines into a universal language of empowerment and innovation and my curiosity knows no boundaries. <br>I am on a journey to learn an art that can open doors of problem solving, creative development and the understanding of nuances in a digital world. <br> As a woman in science, I have always been intrigued by the impact our environments have on us, this is an extension of that. <br> Fundamentally, coding is a manifestation of human imagination; a way that enables us to create solutions with the potential to transform lives by communicating our ideas to machines. <br> When learn how to programme, we step into a world where concepts take shape and that is a power that can bridge the gap between our ideas and reality.</p>
